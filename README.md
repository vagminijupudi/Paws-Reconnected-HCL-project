Paws Reconnected - Pet Lost Management System Website

Abstract

"Paws Connected" is a platform designed with the user in mind allowing them to report lost or found pets. 
When you visit the Home Page you have the option to either log in or sign up. 
Once you've authenticated your account you can fill out the Pet Details Form to report a lost or found pet, which will then be automatically shared on Instagram. 
If your post is successful you'll be redirected to a page where you can provide details, about your pet. 
The website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for its front end development while Node.js, Express.js, ejs and MongoDB power its back end functionality. 
By integrating with Instagram through the Instagram Post API Paws Connected makes it easier to reunite pets with their owners.
